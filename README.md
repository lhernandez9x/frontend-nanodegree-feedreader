# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! My mission was to finish writing the tests in Jasmine and make sure all tests passed.

###How to Run

This page can be run [here](https://lhernandez9x.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/). Alternatively, you can download the zipped archive by clicking [here](https://github.com/lhernandez9x/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/archive/gh-pages.zip).

####What is being tested 

- **RSS Feeds**
 -Tests are run to ensure that there are Feeds present, that they have a title and also that they have a valid URL.

- **The Menu**
 -Tests are run to make sure that the menu is hidden by default and that the menu's visibility changes when the icon is clicked.

- **Initial Feeds**
 -Tests are run to make sure that there are entries in the feed container once the ajax call is run to get feeds.

- **New Feed Selection**
 -These tests check if the content changes when the load feed ajax call runs for each feed.
